This project is using python 2.7.13, numpy 1.11.3, pandas 0.19.2, and scikit-learn 0.18.1.

The first piece of code, Preprocessing focused on the preprocessing of data, namely the reality check and the value centerization.

The second piece of code, Regressor, imported different regressors from sklearn and did some experiments with the regressors.

This is a simple project aiming at having some real machine-learning experience, and more insite on the regressors.
